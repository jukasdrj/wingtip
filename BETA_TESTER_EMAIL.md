# Wingtip Beta Testing Welcome Email

**Subject: You're Invited to Beta Test Wingtip - Library Manager App**

---

Hi [Tester Name],

Thank you for agreeing to beta test **Wingtip**, a local-first library manager that uses your camera to scan and catalog book spines!

## Getting Started

1. **Install TestFlight** from the App Store (if you don't have it already)
2. **Open the invitation link** sent in a separate email from Apple
3. Tap **Accept** and then **Install**
4. **Launch Wingtip** from your home screen

The app will walk you through a quick onboarding and ask for camera permission.

## What is Wingtip?

Wingtip is an iOS-first app designed for book lovers who want to:
- Quickly catalog their physical book collection
- Search and browse their library offline
- Track book statistics and collections
- Maintain complete privacy with local-first storage

All your book data is stored locally on your device. Images are temporarily uploaded to our AI service for identification, then immediately deleted after processing.

## What We Need You to Test

Please focus on these key areas during your beta testing:

### 1. Book Scanning
- **Test the camera scanning**: Point your camera at book spines and tap the shutter button
- **Try different conditions**: Good lighting, low light, various spine styles
- **Test multiple books**: Scan at least 10-15 books to get a feel for accuracy
- **Note any issues**: Blurry results, incorrect identifications, crashes

### 2. Library Management
- **Browse your library**: Scroll through your book collection
- **Use search**: Try searching by title, author, and ISBN
- **Edit book details**: Tap a book and try editing its information
- **Delete books**: Test removing books from your library

### 3. Offline Mode
- **Turn off Wi-Fi**: Disable internet and test browsing your library
- **Test search offline**: Ensure full-text search works without connection
- **Try scanning offline**: Verify the app shows appropriate feedback

### 4. Performance & UI
- **Note any lag**: Especially during scrolling or search
- **Watch for crashes**: Any unexpected exits or freezes
- **UI feedback**: Does everything feel responsive and intuitive?
- **Report visual bugs**: Missing borders, incorrect colors, layout issues

## How to Send Feedback

### Method 1: Shake-to-Feedback (Recommended)
1. **Shake your device** anywhere in the app
2. A feedback form will appear automatically
3. Describe what happened
4. Tap **Send** - device info and logs are included automatically

### Method 2: Via Debug Menu
1. From the Camera screen, tap the **gear icon** (top-left)
2. Scroll to **"Send Feedback"** section
3. Tap **"Send Feedback"** button
4. Fill out the form and tap **Send**

### Method 3: TestFlight App
1. Open the **TestFlight** app
2. Select **Wingtip**
3. Tap **"Send Beta Feedback"**
4. Include screenshots if relevant

## Known Issues

We're aware of these issues and are working on fixes:

- **First camera load**: May take 1-2 seconds on first launch
- **Search performance**: Large collections (>500 books) may see slight delays
- **Rate limiting**: Rapid scanning (~20+ scans in a row) may trigger rate limits
- **Cover image caching**: First time loading cover images may be slow

Please still report these if you encounter them - we want to know how frequently they occur!

## Testing Goals

We're aiming to answer these questions through your testing:

1. **Accuracy**: How often does the book identification work correctly?
2. **Performance**: Does the app feel fast and responsive?
3. **Stability**: Are there any crashes or major bugs?
4. **Usability**: Is the interface intuitive? Any confusing flows?
5. **Edge cases**: What happens with unusual book spines, damaged covers, etc?

## Privacy & Data

- All book data is stored **locally on your device**
- Images are **temporarily uploaded** for AI processing only
- We **immediately delete** images after processing
- No personal data is collected except:
  - Anonymous device ID (for rate limiting)
  - Crash reports (via Sentry, opt-in)
  - Feedback you explicitly send

You can view your device ID and export your library data anytime from the Debug Settings menu.

## What's Next?

This beta testing period will run for **approximately 2-3 weeks**. During this time:

- We'll release updates based on your feedback
- TestFlight will notify you of new builds automatically
- Critical bugs will be fixed as soon as possible
- You'll receive a summary email at the end with final notes

After beta testing, we'll prepare for public App Store release!

## Questions or Issues?

If you have any questions or encounter problems:

- **Email**: feedback@ooheynerds.com
- **Use shake-to-feedback** in the app
- **TestFlight feedback** via the TestFlight app

## Thank You!

Your feedback is incredibly valuable in making Wingtip the best book management app it can be. We're excited to have you as part of the beta testing team!

Happy scanning! 📚

P.S. If you have a large bookshelf to scan, try scanning 5-10 books at a time for best results. The AI works best with clear, well-lit book spines.
