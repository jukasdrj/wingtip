## Description (4000 characters max)

Wingtip is a privacy-first personal library manager that puts you in control. Using advanced AI-powered spine recognition, simply point your camera at your bookshelf and watch as Wingtip identifies and catalogs your entire collection in seconds.

**Key Features:**

• **Camera-Based Cataloging** - Scan book spines with your camera. AI identifies titles, authors, and fetches metadata automatically. No manual typing required.

• **100% Local-First** - All your library data lives on your device in a local SQLite database. No cloud sync requirements. Your books, your data, forever.

• **Works Offline** - View, search, and manage your entire library without an internet connection. Only scanning requires network access for AI identification.

• **Lightning-Fast Search** - Full-text search powered by SQLite FTS5 finds any book instantly. Search by title, author, or ISBN.

• **Swiss Design Aesthetic** - Clean, high-contrast OLED black interface with zero elevation. Borders instead of shadows. Designed for readability and battery efficiency.

• **Export Your Data** - Export your entire library as CSV anytime. Your data is never locked in.

• **No Ads, No Tracking** - Zero analytics, zero tracking, zero data collection. We don't know what books you own and we never will.

**Perfect For:**

- Book collectors managing personal libraries
- Students organizing academic textbooks
- Book lovers who value privacy
- Anyone tired of cloud-dependent apps

**How It Works:**

1. Point your camera at a book spine
2. Tap the shutter button
3. AI identifies the book and enriches with metadata
4. Your library updates instantly

Wingtip connects to our Talaria AI service only during scanning to identify books. All other operations work completely offline. Your library data never leaves your device.

**Built for iOS** - Optimized for iPhone with native performance, proper haptic feedback, and ProMotion display support.
